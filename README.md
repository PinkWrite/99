# PinkWrite 99
**Typing and Editing for Learners and Teachers**

A composition classroom: Writers draft without paste-cheating, Editors review and redraft, Observers watch, Administrators run a Facility (school), a Superintendent runs several Facilities. Blocks are classes.

## Stack
PHP 8 + MariaDB (InnoDB) + PDO. Object pages import only the modules they use (`$import = ['auth','writ']`).

## Install
1. Clone into the web folder (`/srv/www/99/webdir` or similar).
2. Create a MariaDB database and user.
3. Open `install.php`. Database host should be `127.0.0.1` (TCP), not `localhost` (Unix socket).
4. Host setting is **scheme-less**: `write.pink`, `99.example.org`, or `example.org/99`. The app always uses `https://`.
5. That creates a **Superintendent**. Create a Facility, then an Administrator.
6. Mail, SMTP password, host, OAuth keys, and the update **stream** live in `config.php` — SysAdmin work, not the in-app Admin. Superintendents cannot change those from the web.

Walk-in Superintendent recovery: set `allow_create_super` to `true` in config, open `install.php`, then set it `false` again.

## Update
- CLI: `php bin/update.php` or `bash bin/pw99-update`
- Admin / Superintendent locker: **Update app**
- Pulls the GitHub branch named in `config.php` as `stream` (never overwrites `config.php`), then runs SQL migrations.
- If `stream` is missing, older `github_branch` still works. The name `main` is treated as `master`.

## Streams
Two branches. `stream` is SysAdmin-only. Edit `config.php`. There is no in-app control.

| stream | What it is |
|---|---|
| `master` | Published line. Default. |
| `developer` | In-progress work. Point a box here to follow that branch. |

## Google and GitHub login
Empty `id` or `secret` in `config.php` hides that button. Callback for both providers is `https://{host}/oauth.php` (the same `host` value as in config, with `https://` in front).

| Provider | Where to get the keys | What to paste |
|---|---|---|
| Google | [Google Cloud credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) — create an **OAuth client ID**, application type **Web application**. Authorized redirect URI: `https://{host}/oauth.php` | `oauth.google.id` and `oauth.google.secret` |
| GitHub | [GitHub Developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) — **OAuth Apps** → New OAuth App. Authorization callback URL: `https://{host}/oauth.php` | `oauth.github.id` and `oauth.github.secret` |

```php
'oauth' => [
    'google' => ['id' => '….apps.googleusercontent.com', 'secret' => '…'],
    'github' => ['id' => 'Ov…', 'secret' => '…'],
],
```

## Migrating an old dump
The mysqli-era tree and `sql/legacy-lift.sql` live on the [legacy](https://github.com/PinkWrite/99/tree/legacy) history. Read that README. Import the dump into an empty database, then `php bin/update.php` on `master` (same lift in PHP).

## Roles
| Role | Seat |
|---|---|
| Writer | Student |
| Observer | Parent / tutor |
| Editor | Teacher |
| Supervisor | Facility staff |
| Admin | One Facility |
| Superintendent | Many Facilities; password reset is in-person only |

## Features
- Writs, Assignments (writ + memo instructions), Tests (MC / fill-in / short answer / T-F)
- Fill-in: `||` is OR; `|&` is AND/OR (either or both). No exclusive AND.
- Redraft: editor version becomes the writer's next start. `drafts` and `redrafts` JSON history. **Show history** or gray **no history**.
- Note → Memo; Memo → Assignment.
- Lost-password email (Admin and below). TOTP authenticator. Passkeys. After passkey or Google / GitHub, Authenticator can **Remember this machine** for 30 days; password login always asks for the code.
- Google and GitHub login (SysAdmin `oauth` keys in config). Create or link. Authenticator and passkeys still apply after a social login.
- In-app + email notification checkboxes in the Locker. Acknowledge deletes the notice.
