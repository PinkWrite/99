	</li>
	<li>
		Relating to any partner programs, we may collect "analytics" or "tracking" information from third party websites to keep track of the number of times content may be view through partners, which is for the purpose of calculating a fair percentage of contribution and thus any agreed-to profit sharing. Such terms shall be explained further to those partners who opt-in to any such partner programs.
	</li>
	<li>
		We will collect personal information by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.

		We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
	</li>
	<li>
		We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices relating to the management of personal information.
	</li>
	<li>
		While we will remove as many private records when a user deletes an account so associated, we will retain copies of all correspondence, email or physical, and records relating to any applicable finances or payout or shares thereof.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained.</p>
